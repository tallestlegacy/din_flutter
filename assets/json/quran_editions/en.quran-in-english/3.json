    "Alif. Lam. Meem.",
    "God. There is no god but He—the Living, the Eternal.",
    "He sent down to you the Book with the Truth, confirming what came before it; and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel.",
    "Aforetime, as guidance for humanity; and He sent down the Criterion. Those who reject God’s communications will have a severe punishment. God is Mighty, Capable of revenge.",
    "Nothing is hidden from God, on earth or in heaven.",
    "It is He who forms you in the wombs as He wills. There is no god except He—the Almighty, the Wise.",
    "It is He who revealed to you the Book. Some of its verses are definitive; they are the foundation of the Book, and others are metaphorical. As for those in whose hearts is deviation: they follow the metaphorical ones, seeking disorder, and seeking to derive an interpretation. But none knows its interpretation except God and those firmly rooted in knowledge say, “We believe in it; all is from our Lord.” But none remembers except those with understanding.",
    "“Our Lord, do not make our hearts deviate after having guided us, and bestow on us mercy from Your Presence; You are the Giver.”",
    "“Our Lord, You will gather the people for a Day in which there is no doubt.” God does not break the promise.",
    "As for those who disbelieve, their wealth and children will never benefit them against God. These are Fuel for the Fire.",
    "Like the behavior of Pharaoh’s people and those before them. They rejected Our signs, so God seized them for their sins. God is Severe in retribution.",
    "Say to those who disbelieve, “You will be defeated, and gathered into Hell—an awful place.”",
    "There was a sign for you in the two parties that met. One party fighting in God’s way, and the other disbelieving. They saw them twice as many, with their own eyes. But God supports with His help whomever He wills. There is a lesson in this for those who have insight.",
    "Adorned for the people is the love of desires: women, and children, and piles upon piles of gold and silver, and branded horses, and livestock, and fields. These are the conveniences of the worldly life, while with God is the best place to return.",
    "Say, “Shall I inform you of something better than that? For those who are righteous: with their Lord are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, remaining in there forever, and purified spouses, and acceptance from God.” God is Observant of the worshipers.",
    "Those who say, “Our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us our sins, and protect us from the suffering of the Fire.”",
    "The patient, the truthful, the reverent, the charitable, the seekers of forgiveness at dawn.",
    "God bears witness that there is no god but He—as do the angels, and those endowed with knowledge—upholding justice. There is no god but He, the All-powerful, the Wise.",
    "Religion with God is Submission. Those who were given the Scripture differed only after knowledge came to them, due to envy among them. Whoever rejects the Revelations of God—God is swift in reckoning.",
    "If they dispute with you, say, “I have submitted myself to God, and so did my followers.” And say to those who were given the Scripture, and to the unlearned, “Have you submitted?” If they have submitted, then they have been guided. But if they turn away, then your responsibility is to convey. God is Seeing of the servants.",
    "As for those who defy God’s revelations, and wrongfully kill the prophets, and kill those who advocate justice among the people—promise them a painful punishment.",
    "They are those whose deeds will come to nothing in this world and in the Hereafter, and there are no helpers for them.",
    "Have you not considered those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They were invited to God’s Scripture, to arbitrate between them. Then some of them turned back and declined.",
    "That is because they said, “The Fire will not touch us except for a limited number of days.” They were deceived in their faith by the lies they fabricated.",
    "How about when We gather them for a Day in which there is no doubt, and every soul is repaid as it deserves, and they will not be wronged?",
    "Say, “O God, Master of Sovereignty. You grant sovereignty to whom You will, and You strip sovereignty from whom you will. You honor whom you will, and You humiliate whom you will. In Your hand is all goodness. You are capable of all things.”",
    "“You merge the night into the day, and You merge the day into the night. And You bring the living from the dead, and You bring the dead from the living. And You provide for whom You will, without measure.”",
    "Believers shall not take disbelievers for allies instead of believers. Whoever does that has nothing to do with God, unless you cautiously protect yourself from them. God warns you of Himself. And to God is the destination.",
    "Say, “Whether you conceal what is in your hearts, or disclose it, God knows it.” He knows everything in the heavens and the earth. And God is capable of all things.",
    "On the Day when every soul will find all the good it has done presented. And as for the evil it has done, it will wish there were a great distance between them. God cautions you of Himself. God is Kind towards the worshipers.",
    "Say, “If you love God, then follow me, and God will love you, and will forgive you your sins.” God is Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "Say, “Obey God and the Messenger.” But if they turn away—God does not love the faithless.",
    "God chose Adam, and Noah, and the family of Abraham, and the family of Imran over all humankind.",
    "Offspring, one of the other. God is Hearer and Knower.",
    "The wife of Imran said, “My Lord, I have vowed what is in my womb, to You, dedicated, so accept it from me; You are the Hearer and Knower.”",
    "And when she delivered her, she said, “My Lord, I have delivered a female,” and God knew what she delivered, “and the male is not like the female, and I have named her Mary, I place her and her children under your protection from Satan the outcast.”",
    "Her Lord accepted her with a gracious reception, and brought her a beautiful upbringing, and entrusted her to the care of Zechariah. Whenever Zechariah visited her in the sanctuary, he found her supplied with provision. He said, “O Mary, where did you get this from?” She said, “It is from God; God provides to whom He wills, without account.”",
    "There and then, Zechariah prayed to his Lord. He said, “My Lord, grant me—by your grace—righteous offspring. You are the Hearer of Prayers.”",
    "So then the angels called out to him, while he stood praying in the sanctuary: “God gives you good news of John, confirming a word from God, and honorable, and moral, and a prophet from the righteous.”",
    "He said, “My Lord, how will I have a son, when old age has overtaken me, and my wife is barren?” He said, “Even so, God does whatever He wills.”",
    "He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, “Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three days, except by gestures. And remember your Lord frequently, and praise in the evening and the morning.”",
    "The angels said, “O Mary, God has chosen you, and has purified you. He has chosen you over all the women of the world.”",
    "“O Mary, be devoted to your Lord, and bow down, and kneel with those who kneel.”",
    "These are accounts from the Unseen which We reveal to you. You were not with them when they cast their lots as to which of them would care for Mary; nor were you with them as they quarreled.",
    "The Angels said, “O Mary, God gives you good news of a Word from Him. His name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, highly distinguished in this world and the next, and one of the nearest.",
    "He will speak to the people from the crib, and in adulthood, and will be among the righteous.”",
    "She said, “My Lord, how can I have a child when no human has touched me?” He said, “It will be so. God creates whatever He wills. When He decides on an issue, He says to it, ‘Be!’ and it is.”",
    "And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel.",
    "And a messenger to the Children of Israel: “I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. I make for you out of clay the shape of a bird; then I breathe in it, and it becomes a bird by God’s leave. And I heal the blind and the leprous, and I revive the dead, by God’s leave. And I prophesy what you eat, and what you store in your homes. In this is a sign for you, if you are believers.”",
    "“And confirming what is before me of the Torah, and to make permissible for you some of what was forbidden to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. So reverence God, and obey me.”",
    "“God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.”",
    "When Jesus sensed disbelief on their part, he said, “Who are my helpers towards God?” The disciples said, “We are God’s helpers; we have believed in God, so bear witness that we are submitters.”",
    "“Our Lord, we believed in what You have revealed, and we followed the Messenger, so count us among the witnesses.”",
    "They plotted, and God planned, but God is the Best of planners.",
    "God said, “O Jesus, I am completing your life, and raising you to Me, and clearing you of those who disbelieve. And I will make those who follow you above those who disbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you regarding your disputes.",
    "As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with severe punishment, in this life and the next, and they will have no helpers.",
    "And as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their rewards in full. God does not love the unjust.”",
    "This is what We relate to you of the Verses and the Wise Reminder.",
    "The example of Jesus with God is like Adam: He created him from dust, then He said to him, “Be!” and he was.",
    "The truth is from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.",
    "And if anyone disputes with you about him, after the knowledge that has come to you, say, “Come, let us gather our children and your children, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, then let us invoke God’s curse on the liars.”",
    "This is the true story: there is no god except God. God is the Mighty, the Wise.",
    "But if they turn away—God knows the corrupters.",
    "Say, “O People of the Scripture, come to terms common between us and you: that we worship none but God, and that we associate nothing with Him, and that none of us takes others as lords besides God.” And if they refuse, say, “be witness that we are Submitters.”",
    "O People of the Scripture! Why do you argue about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? Do you not reason?",
    "Here you are—you argue about things you know, but why do you argue about things you do not know? God knows, and you do not know.",
    "Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a Monotheist, a Muslim. And he was not of the associators.",
    "The people most deserving of Abraham are those who followed him, and this prophet, and those who believe. God is the Protector of believers.",
    "A group among the People of the Scripture would love to mislead you. But they mislead none but themselves, and they are unaware.",
    "O People of the Scripture! Why do you reject the revelations of God, when you yourselves are witnesses?",
    "O People of the Scripture! Why do you mix the truth with falsehood, and conceal the truth knowingly?",
    "Some of the People of the Scripture say, “Believe in what was revealed to the believers during the daytime, and reject it at its end, so they may return.”",
    "And trust none except those who follow your way of life. Say, “Guidance is God’s guidance. If someone is given the like of what you were given, or they argue with you before your Lord, say, “All grace is in God’s hand; He gives it to whomever He wills. God is Bountiful and Knowing.”",
    "He allocates His mercy for whomever He wills. God is Possessor of Sublime Grace.",
    "And among the People of the Scripture is he, who, if you entrust him with a heap of gold, he will return it to you. And among them is he, who, if you entrust him with a single coin, he will not return it to you, unless you keep after him. That is because they say, “We are under no obligation towards the Gentiles.” They tell lies about God, and they know it.",
    "Indeed, whoever fulfills his commitments and is cautious—God loves the reverent.",
    "Those who exchange God’s covenant, and their vows, for a small price, will have no share in the Hereafter, and God will not speak to them, nor will He look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. They will have a painful punishment.",
    "Among them are those who twist the Scripture with their tongues, so that you may think it from the Scripture—when it is not from the Scripture. And they say, “It is from God”—when it is not from God. They tell lies, and they attribute them to God, knowingly.",
    "No person to whom God has given the Scripture, judgment, and prophethood would say to the people, “Be my worshippers, rather than God’s.” But, “Be people of the Lord, according to the Scripture you teach, and the teachings you study.”",
    "Nor would he instruct you to take the angels and the prophets as lords. Will he instruct you to infidelity after you have submitted?",
    "God received the covenant of the prophets, “Inasmuch as I have given you of Scripture and wisdom; should a messenger come to you confirming what you have, you shall believe in him, and support him.” He said, “Do you affirm My covenant, and take it upon yourselves?” They said, “We affirm it.” He said, “Then be witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.”",
    "Whoever turns away after that—these are the disobedient.",
    "Do they seek other than the religion of God, when to Him has submitted everything in the heavens and on earth, willingly or unwillingly; and to Him, they will be returned?",
    "Say, “We believe in God, and in what was revealed to us; and in what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord. We do not differentiate between any of them. And to Him, we submit.”",
    "Whoever seeks a religion other than Submission: it will not be accepted from him; and in the Hereafter, he will be among the losers.",
    "How will God guide a people who disbelieved after having believed, and had witnessed that the Messenger is true, and the clear proofs did come to them? God does not guide the unjust people.",
    "These—their penalty is that upon them falls the curse of God, and of the angels, and of humanity.",
    "Remaining in it eternally. The suffering will not be eased for them, nor will they be given relief.",
    "Except those who repent afterward—and reform. God is Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "As for those who disbelieve after having believed, then plunge deeper in disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted—it is they who are astray.",
    "As for those who disbelieve, and die as disbelievers: even the earth full of gold would not be accepted from any of them, were he to offer it for ransom. It is they who will suffer a painful agony, and they will have no helpers.",
    "You will never attain virtuous conduct until you give from what you love. Whatever you give away, God knows about it.",
    "All food was permissible for the Children of Israel—except what Israel forbade for itself—before the Torah was revealed. Say, “Bring the Torah, and read it, if you are truthful.”",
    "Whoever fabricates lies against God after that—these are the wrongdoers.",
    "Say, “God has spoken the truth. So follow the faith of Abraham, the Monotheist—who was not of the associators.”",
    "The first house established for humanity is the one in Bekkah—full of blessings, and guidance for humanity.",
    "In it are clear signs: the Station of Abraham. Whoever enters it attains security. Pilgrimage to the House is a duty upon people before God for those who can make the journey. But whoever refuses—God is Independent of the worlds.",
    "Say, “O People of the Scripture, why do you reject God’s revelations, when God is Witness over what you do?”",
    "Say, “O People of the Scripture, why do you hinder from God’s path those who believe, seeking to distort it, even though you are witnesses? God is not unaware of what you do.”",
    "O you who believe! If you obey a group among those who were given the Book, they will turn you, after your belief, into unbelievers.",
    "And how could you disbelieve, when God’s revelations are being recited to you, and His Messenger is among you? Whoever clings to God has been guided to a straight path.",
    "O you who believe! Revere God with due reverence, and do not die except in Submission.",
    "And hold firmly to the rope of God, all together, and be not divided. And remember God’s favor upon you; when you were enemies, and He united your hearts, and by His grace you became brethren. And you were on the brink of a fiery pit, and He saved you from it. Thus God clarifies his revelations to you, so you may be guided.",
    "And let there be among you a community calling to virtue, and advocating righteousness, and deterring from evil. These are the successful.",
    "And be not like those who became divided and disputed after the clear proofs came to them. It is they who will have a great punishment.",
    "On the Day when faces whiten and faces blacken. As for those whose faces blacken: “Did you disbelieve after having believed?” So taste the punishment for having disbelieved.",
    "But as for those whose faces whiten: they are in God’s mercy, remaining in it forever.",
    "These are God’s revelations. We recite them to you in truth. God desires no injustice for the people.",
    "To God belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. And to God, all events are returned.",
    "You are the best community that ever emerged for humanity: you advocate what is moral, and forbid what is immoral, and believe in God. Had the People of the Scripture believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are the faithful, but most of them are sinful.",
    "They will not harm you, beyond insulting you. And if they fight you, they will turn around and flee, and they will not be helped.",
    "They will be humiliated wherever they are encountered, except through a rope from God, and a rope from people; and they have incurred wrath from God, and they were stricken with misery. That is because they rejected God’s revelations, and killed the prophets unjustly. That is because they rebelled and committed aggression.",
    "They are not alike: among the People of the Scripture is an upright community; they read God’s revelations throughout the night, and they bow down.",
    "They believe in God and the Last Day, and advocate righteousness, and forbid evil, and are quick to do good deeds. These are among the righteous.",
    "Whatever good they do, they will not be denied it. God knows the reverent.",
    "As for those who disbelieve: neither their wealth nor their children will avail them anything against God. These are the inhabitants of the Fire, where they will remain forever.",
    "The parable of what they spend in this worldly life is that of a frosty wind that strikes the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves, and it destroys it. God did not wrong them, but they wronged their own selves.",
    "O you who believe! Do not befriend outsiders who spare no effort to ruin you. They love to see you suffer. Hatred is apparent in what they say, but what their hearts conceal is worse. We made the communications clear for you—if you understand.",
    "Here you are! You love them, but they do not love you, and you believe in the entire Scripture. And when they meet you, they say, “We believe.” But when they are alone, they bite their fingers at you in rage. Say, “Die in your rage; God knows what the hearts contain.”",
    "If goodness befalls you, it upsets them; but if something bad befalls you, they rejoice in it. But if you are patient and maintain righteousness, their schemes will not harm you in the least. God comprehends what they do.",
    "Remember when you left your family in the morning, to assign for the believers battle-positions. God is Hearing and Knowing.",
    "When two groups among you almost faltered, but God was their Protector. So in God let the believers trust.",
    "God had given you victory at Badr when you were weak. So be mindful of God, so that you may be thankful.",
    "When you said to the believers, “Is it not enough for you, that your Lord has reinforced you with three thousand angels, sent down?”",
    "Most certainly. But if you persevere and remain cautious, and they attack you suddenly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels, well trained.",
    "God has made it but a message of hope for you, and to reassure your hearts with it. There is no victory except from God the Mighty, the Wise.",
    "In order to destroy a flank of those who disbelieved, or to subdue them, so that they retreat disappointed.",
    "It is no concern of yours: whether He accepts their repentance, or He punishes them. They are wrongdoers.",
    "To God belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. God is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "O you who believe! Do not feed on usury, compounded over and over—and fear God, so that you may prosper.",
    "And protect yourselves from the Fire that is prepared for the unbelievers.",
    "And obey God and the Messenger, so you may receive mercy.",
    "And race towards forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden as wide as the heavens and the earth: prepared for the cautious.",
    "Those who give in prosperity and in adversity, and restrain anger, and forgive people. God loves the doers of good.",
    "And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember God and ask forgiveness for their sins—and who except God forgives sins? And they do not knowingly persist in their wrongdoing.",
    "These—their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, remaining in it forever. How excellent is the reward of the workers!",
    "Many societies have passed away before you. So travel the earth, and note the fate of the deniers.",
    "This is a proclamation to humanity; and guidance and advice for the righteous.",
    "And do not waver, nor be sad. You are the superior ones—if you are believers.",
    "If an injury has afflicted you, a similar injury has afflicted the others. Such days We alternate between people, so that God may know those who believe, and to take witnesses from among you. God does not love the wrongdoers.",
    "So that God may refine those who believe, and to wipe out the unbelievers.",
    "Or do you expect to enter Paradise, before God has recognized those among you who strive, and before He has recognized the patient?",
    "And you used to wish for death before you have faced it. Now you have seen it with your own eyes.",
    "Muhammad is no more than a messenger. Messengers have passed before him. If he dies or gets killed, will you turn on your heels? He who turns on his heels will not harm God in any way. And God will reward the appreciative.",
    "No soul can die except with God’s permission, at a predetermined time. Whoever desires the reward of the world, We will give him some of it. And whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We will give him some of it. And We will reward the thankful.",
    "How many a prophet fought alongside him, numerous godly people? They did not waver for what afflicted them in God’s path, nor did they weaken, nor did they give in. God loves those who endure.",
    "Their only words were, “Our Lord, forgive us our offenses and our excesses in our conduct, and strengthen our foothold, and help us against the disbelieving people.”",
    "So God gave them the reward of this world, and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. God loves the good-doers.",
    "O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you turn losers.",
    "God is your Master, and He is the Best of Victors.",
    "We will strike terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve—because they attribute to God partners—a practice He never authorized. Their lodging is the Fire. Miserable is the lodging of the evildoers.",
    "God has fulfilled His promise to you, when you defeated them by His leave; until when you faltered, and quarreled with one another about the matter, and disobeyed after He had shown you what you love. Among you are those who desire this world, and among you are those who desire the Hereafter. Then He turned you away from them, to test you; but He pardoned you. God is Gracious towards the believers.",
    "As you were climbing, not caring for anyone, and the Messenger was calling you from behind you. Then He afflicted you with sorrow upon sorrow, so that you would not grieve over what you missed, nor for what afflicted you. God is well aware of what you do.",
    "Then, after the setback, He sent tranquility down upon you. Drowsiness overcame some of you, while others cared only for themselves, entertaining wrong thoughts about God—thoughts of ignorance—saying, “Is anything up to us?” Say, “Everything is up to God.” They hide within themselves what they do not disclose to you. And they say, “If it was up to us, none of us would have been killed here.” Say, “Even if you were in your houses, those destined to be killed would have marched into their deathbeds.” Thus God tests what is within you, and He purifies what is in your hearts. God knows what the hearts contain.",
    "Those of you who fled on the day the two groups met: it was Satan who caused them to backslide, on account of some of what they committed. But God has forgiven them. God is Forgiving, Clement.",
    "O you who believe! Do not be like those who disbelieved, and said of their brethren who marched in the land, or went on the offensive, “Had they stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” So that God may make it a source of regret in their hearts. God gives life and causes death. God is Seeing of what you do.",
    "If you are killed in the way of God, or you die—forgiveness and mercy from God are better than what they hoard.",
    "Whether you die or get killed—to God you will be gathered.",
    "It is by mercy from God that you were gentle with them. Had you been rude, hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you. So pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them in the conduct of affairs. And when you make a decision, put your trust in God; God loves the trusting.",
    "If God supports you, there is none who can defeat you. But if He fails you, who is there to help you after Him? So in God, let the believers put their trust.",
    "It is not for a prophet to act dishonestly. Whoever acts dishonestly will bring his dishonesty on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and they will not be wronged.",
    "Is he who pursues God's approval like him who incurs God's wrath and his dwelling is Hell—the miserable destination?",
    "They have different ranks with God, and God is Seeing of what they do.",
    "God has favored the believers, as He raised up among them a messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His revelations, and purifying them, and teaching them the Scripture and Wisdom; while aforetime they were in obvious error.",
    "And when a calamity befell you, even after you had inflicted twice as much, you said, “How could this be?” Say, “You brought it on yourselves.” God has power over all things.",
    "What befell you on the day the two groups met was according to God's will; so that the believers may know.",
    "And so that the hypocrites may know. And it was said to them, “Come, fight in the way of God, or defend yourselves.” They said, “If we knew how to fight, we would have followed you.” That day they were closer to disbelief than to belief, saying with their mouths what is not in their hearts. But God knows best what they hide.",
    "Those who said of their brethren, as they stayed behind, “Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.” Say, “Avert death from yourselves, if you are truthful.”",
    "Do not consider those killed in God’s way as dead. In fact, they are alive, with their Lord, provided for.",
    "Delighting in what God has given them from His bounty, and happy for those who have not yet joined them from among those who remained behind—that they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.",
    "Rejoicing in blessing from God, and bounty, and that God will not waste the reward of the faithful.",
    "Those who responded to God and the Messenger, despite the persecution they had suffered; for the virtuous and the reverent among them is a great reward.",
    "Those to whom the people said, “The people have mobilized against you, so fear them.” But it increased them in faith, and they said, “God is enough for us; He is the Excellent Protector.”",
    "So they came back with grace from God, and bounty, untouched by evil. And they pursued what pleases God. God possesses immense grace.",
    "That is only Satan sowing fear in his allies; so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are believers.",
    "And do not be saddened by those who rush into disbelief. They will not harm God a bit. God intends to give them no share in the Hereafter, and they will have a terrible punishment.",
    "Those who purchase disbelief at the price of belief will not harm God a bit. They will have a painful punishment.",
    "Let not those who disbelieve assume that We delay them for their own good. In fact, We only delay them so that they may increase in sinfulness. They will suffer a humiliating punishment.",
    "God would not leave the believers as you are, without identifying the insincere from the sincere. Nor would God inform you about the future, but God chooses from among His messengers whom He wills. So believe in God and His messengers. And if you believe and protect yourselves, you will have a splendid reward.",
    "Those who withhold what God has given them of his abundance should not consider it good for them. In fact, it is bad for them. They will be encircled by their hoardings on the Day of Resurrection. To God belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth, and God is Aware of whatever they do.",
    "God has heard the statement of those who said, “God is poor, and we are rich.” We will record what they said, and their wrongful killing of the prophets; and We will say, “Taste the suffering of burning.”",
    "“That is because of what your hands have committed, and because God is never unjust towards the servants.”",
    "Those who said, “God has made a covenant with us, that we shall not believe in any messenger unless he brings us an offering consumed by fire.” Say, “Messengers have come to you before me, with clear proofs, and with what you demanded; so why did you assassinate them, if you are truthful?”",
    "If they accuse you of lying, messengers before you were accused of lying—they came with clear proofs, divine books, and the Luminous Scripture.",
    "Every soul will taste death, and you will receive your compensation on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire, and admitted to Paradise, has won. The life of this world is merely the enjoyment of delusion.",
    "You will be tested through your possessions and your persons. And you will hear from those who received the Scripture before you, and from those who associated much abuse. But if you are patient and reverent, then that is a course worthy of resolve.",
    "God received a pledge from those who were given the Scripture: “You shall proclaim it to the people, and not conceal it.” But they disregarded it behind their backs, and they sold it for a small price—miserable is the exchange they made.",
    "Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done—do not think they can evade the punishment; they will have a painful punishment.",
    "To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. God is Capable of all things.",
    "In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the variation of night and day, are signs for the possessors of understanding.",
    "Those who remember God while standing, sitting, and on their sides; and they reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth: “Our Lord, You did not create this in vain. Glory be to You! So protect us from the suffering of the Fire.”",
    "“Our Lord, whomever You commit to the Fire, You have disgraced. The wrongdoers will have no helpers.”",
    "“Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling to faith: `Believe in your Lord,' so we have believed. Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and remit our misdeeds, and make us die with the virtuous.”",
    "“Our Lord, and give us what You have promised us through Your messengers, and do not shame us on the Day of Resurrection—You never break a promise.”",
    "And so their Lord answered them: “I will not let the work of any worker among you, male or female, be in vain; you are one of another. For those who emigrated, and were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted in my Way, and fought and were killed: I will remit for them their sins, and I will admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow—a reward from God. With God is the most beautiful reward.”",
    "Do not be impressed by the unbelievers’ movement through the land.",
    "A brief enjoyment, then their dwelling is Gehenna—a dreadful dwelling.",
    "As for those who reverence their Lord: for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will stay forever—hospitality from God. What God possesses is best for the pure.",
    "Among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in God, and in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed to them. They are humble before God, and they do not sell God’s revelations for a cheap price. These will have their reward with their Lord. God is quick in settling accounts.",
    "O you who believe! Be patient, and advocate patience, and be united, and revere God, so that you may thrive."
