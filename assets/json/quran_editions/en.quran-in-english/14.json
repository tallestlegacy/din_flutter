    "Alif. Lam. Ra. A Scripture that We revealed to you, so that you may bring people out of the darkness into light—by the will of their Lord—to the path of the Mighty, the Praised.",
    "God—to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. And woe to the unbelievers from a severe punishment.",
    "Those who prefer the present life over the Hereafter, and repel from God’s path, and seek to make it crooked—these are far astray.",
    "We sent no messenger except in the language of his people, to make things clear for them. God leads astray whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills. He is the Mighty, the Wise.",
    "We sent Moses with Our signs: “Bring your people out of darkness into light, and remind them of the Days of God.” In this are signs for every patient, thankful person.”",
    "Moses said to his people, “Remember God’s favors upon you, as He saved you from the people of Pharaoh, who inflicted terrible suffering on you, slaughtering your sons while sparing your women. In that was a severe trial from your Lord.”",
    "And when your Lord announced: “If you give thanks, I will give you more; but if you are ungrateful, My punishment is severe.”",
    "And Moses said, “Even if you are ungrateful, together with everyone on earth—God is in no need, Praised.”",
    "Has not the story reached you, of those before you: the people of Noah, and Aad, and Thamood, and those after them? None knows them except God. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they tried to silence them, and said, “We reject what you are sent with, and we are in serious doubt about what you are calling us to.”",
    "Their messengers said, “Can there be any doubt about God, Maker of the heavens and the earth? He invites you to forgive you of your sins, and to defer you until an appointed time.” They said, “You are only humans like us; you want to turn us away from what our forefathers served; so bring us some compelling proof.”",
    "Their messengers said to them, “We are only humans like you, but God favors whom He wills from among His servants. We cannot possibly bring you any proof, except with God’s permission. And in God, let the faithful put their trust.”",
    "“And why should we not trust in God, when He has guided us in our ways? We will persevere in the face of your persecution. And upon God, the reliant should rely.”",
    "Those who disbelieved said to their messengers, “We will expel you from our land—unless you return to our faith.” And their Lord inspired them: “We will destroy the wrongdoers.”",
    "“And We will settle you in the land after them. This is for whoever fears My Majesty and fears My warnings.”",
    "And they asked for victory, and every stubborn tyrant came to disappointment.",
    "Beyond him lies Hell, and he will be made to drink putrid water.",
    "He will guzzle it, but he will not swallow it. And death will come at him from every direction, but he will not die. And beyond this lies intense suffering.",
    "The parable of those who disbelieve in their Lord: their works are as ashes, in a fierce wind, on a stormy day. They have no control over anything they have gained. That is the utmost misguidance.",
    "Do you not see that God created the heavens and the earth with truth? If He wills, He can eliminate you, and produce a new creation.",
    "And that is not difficult for God.",
    "And they will emerge before God, all together. The weak will say to those who were proud, “We were your followers, so can you protect us from God’s punishment in any way?” They will say, “Had God guided us, we would have guided you. It is the same for us; whether we mourn, or endure patiently; for us, there is no asylum.”",
    "And Satan will say, when judgment is passed, “God has promised you the promise of truth; and I promised you, but I failed you. I had no authority over you, except that I called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves. I cannot respond to your cries, nor can you respond to my cries. I denounce your previous association of me. The wrongdoers will have a painful punishment.”",
    "But those who believe and do righteous deeds will be admitted into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to remain there forever, with their Lord's permission. Their greeting there will be: “Peace.”",
    "Do you not see how God presents a parable? A good word is like a good tree: its root is firm, and its branches are in the sky.",
    "It yields its fruit every season, by the will of its Lord. God presents the parables to the people, so that they may reflect.",
    "And the parable of a bad word is that of a bad tree: it is uprooted from the ground; it has no stability.",
    "God gives firmness to those who believe, with the firm word, in this life, and in the Hereafter. And God leads the unjust astray. And God does whatever He wills.",
    "Have you not seen those who exchange God’s blessings with blasphemy, and land their people into the house of perdition?",
    "Hell—they will roast in it—what a miserable settlement.",
    "And they set up rivals to God, to lead away from His Way. Say, “Enjoy yourselves! Your destination is the Fire.”",
    "Tell My servants who have believed to perform the prayers, and to donate from what We have provided for them—secretly and publicly—before a Day comes in which there is neither bargaining nor friendship.",
    "God is He Who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down water from the sky, causing fruits to grow for your sustenance. And He committed the ships to your service, sailing through the sea by His command, and He committed the rivers to your service.",
    "And He committed the sun and the moon to your service, continuously, and He committed the night and the day to your service.",
    "And He has given you something of all what you asked. And if you were to count God’s blessings, you could not enumerate them. The human being is unfair and ungrateful.",
    "And recall that Abraham said, “O my Lord, make this land secure, and keep me and my children from worshiping idols.”",
    "“My Lord, they have led many people astray. Whoever follows me, he is of me. And whoever disobeys me—You are Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "“Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in a valley of no vegetation, by Your Sacred House, our Lord, so that they may perform the prayers. So make some people's hearts incline towards them, and provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.”",
    "“Our Lord, You know what we hide and what we disclose. And nothing is hidden from God, on earth or in the heaven.”",
    "“Praise be to God, Who has given me, in my old age, Ishmael and Isaac. My Lord is the Hearer of Prayers.”",
    "“My Lord, make me a performer of prayer, and of my descendants. Our Lord, accept my prayers.”",
    "“Our Lord, forgive me, and my parents, and the believers, on the Day the Reckoning takes place.”",
    "Do not ever think that God is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only postpones them until a Day when the sights stare.",
    "Their necks outstretched, their heads upraised, their gaze unblinking, their hearts void.",
    "And warn the people of the Day when the punishment will come upon them, and those who did wrong will say, “Our Lord, delay us for a little while, and we will answer Your call, and follow the messengers.” Did you not swear before, that there would be no end for you?",
    "And you inhabited the homes of those who wronged themselves, and it became clear to you how We dealt with them, and We presented for you the parables.",
    "And they planned their plan, but their plan is with God, even if their plan can eliminate mountains.",
    "Never think that God will break His promise to His messengers. God is Strong, Revengeful.",
    "On the Day when the earth is changed into another earth—and the heavens—and they will emerge before God, the One, the Irresistible.",
    "On that Day, you will see the guilty bound together in chains.",
    "Their garments made of tar, and the fire covering their faces.",
    "So that God may repay each soul for what it has committed. God is Swift in reckoning.",
    "This is a proclamation for humanity, so that they may be warned thereby, and know that He is One God, and so that the possessors of intellect may reflect."
