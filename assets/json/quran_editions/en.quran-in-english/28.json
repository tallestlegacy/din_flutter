    "Ta. Seen. Meem.",
    "These are the Verses of the Clear Book.",
    "We narrate to you from the history of Moses and Pharaoh—in truth—for people who believe.",
    "Pharaoh exalted himself in the land, and he divided its people into factions. Oppressing a group of them: slaughtering their sons, while sparing their women. He was one of the corrupters.",
    "But We intended to favor those who were oppressed in the land, and to make them leaders, and to make them the inheritors.",
    "And to establish them in the land; and to show Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their soldiers, the very thing they feared.",
    "And We inspired the mother of Moses: “Nurse him; but when you fear for him, put him into the river, and do not fear, nor be sad. We will return him to you, and will make him one of the messengers.”",
    "Pharaoh’s household picked him up, only to become their enemy and a source of grief. Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their soldiers were sinful.",
    "Pharaoh’s wife said, “An eye's delight for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.” But they did not foresee.",
    "The heart of Moses’ mother became empty. She was about to disclose him, had We not steadied her heart, so that she may remain a believer.",
    "She said to his sister, “Keep track of him.” So she watched him from a distance, yet they were unaware.",
    "And We forbade him breastfeeding at first. So she said, “Shall I direct you to a family that will raise him for you, and will look after him?”",
    "Thus We returned him to his mother, so that she may be comforted, and not grieve, and know that God’s promise is true. But most of them do not know.",
    "And when he reached full strength and maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus We reward the virtuous.",
    "Once he entered the city, unnoticed by its people. There He found two men fighting. One from his own people, and the other from his enemies. The one from his people called to him for help against the one from his enemies. So Moses struck him, and put an end to him. He said, “This is from Satan's doing. He is an enemy that openly misleads.”",
    "He said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.” So He forgave him. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.",
    "He said, “My Lord! Because of Your favors upon me, I will never be a supporter of the guilty.”",
    "The next morning, he went about in the city, fearful and vigilant, when the man who had sought his help the day before was shouting out to him. Moses said to him, “You are clearly a troublemaker.”",
    "As he was about to strike the one who was their enemy, he said, “O Moses, do you intend to kill me, as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a bully in the land, and you don’t want to be a peacemaker.”",
    "And there came a man, rushing from the outskirts of the city, saying, “O Moses, the authorities are conspiring against you, to kill you, so get out; I am giving you good advice.”",
    "So he left, fearful and vigilant. He said, “My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.”",
    "And as he headed towards Median, he said, “Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right way.”",
    "And when he reached Midian’s water, he found there a crowd of people drawing water, and he noticed two women waiting on the side. He said, “What is the matter with you?” They said, “We cannot draw water until the shepherds depart, and our father is a very old man.”",
    "So he drew water for them. Then he withdrew to the shade, and said, “My Lord, I am in dire need of whatever good you might send down to me.”",
    "Then, one of the two women approached him, walking bashfully. She said, “My father is inviting you, to compensate you for having drawn water for us.” And when he came and told him the story, he said, “Do not fear, you have escaped from the wrongdoing people.”",
    "One of the two women said, “Father, hire him. The best employee for you is the strong and trustworthy.”",
    "He said, “I wish to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, provided you stay in my service for eight years. But if you complete ten, it is up to you. I do not intend to be hard on you. You will find me, God willing, of the righteous.”",
    "He said, “Let this be an agreement between you and me. Whichever of the two terms I complete, there shall be no reprisal against me. And God is Guardian over what we say.”",
    "When Moses completed the term and departed with his family, he noticed a fire by the side of the Mount. He said to his family, “Stay here; I have glimpsed a fire. Perhaps I can bring you some information from there, or a torch from the fire, so that you may warm yourselves.”",
    "And when he reached it, he was called from the right bank of the valley, at the Sacred Ground, from the bush: “O Moses, it is I, God, Lord of the Worlds.",
    "Throw down your cane.” And when he saw it wiggling, as if it were possessed, he turned in retreat without returning. “O Moses, draw near, and do not fear, you are perfectly safe.",
    "Put your hand inside your pocket, and it will come out white, without blemish. And press your arm to your side, against fear. These are two proofs from your Lord, to Pharaoh and his chiefs. They are sinful people.”",
    "He said, “My Lord, I have killed one of them, so I fear they will kill me.",
    "And my brother Aaron: he is more eloquent than me in speech, so send him with me, to help me, and to confirm my words, for I fear they will reject me.”",
    "He said, “We will strengthen you with your brother, and We will give you authority—so they cannot reach you. By virtue of Our signs, you and those who follow you will be the victors.”",
    "But when Moses came to them with Our proofs, clear and obvious, they said, “This is nothing but fabricated magic, and We never heard of this from our ancestors of old.”",
    "Moses said, “My Lord knows best who brings guidance from Him, and who will have the final Home. The wrongdoers will not succeed.”",
    "Pharaoh said, “O nobles, I know of no god for you other than me. So fire-up the bricks for me, O Hamaan, and make me a tower, so I may look at the God of Moses, although I think he is a liar.”",
    "He and his soldiers acted arrogantly in the land, with no justification. They thought they would not be returned to Us.",
    "So We seized him and his soldiers, and We threw them into the sea. Observe, therefore, what the end of the oppressors was.",
    "And We made them leaders calling to the Fire. And on Resurrection Day, they will not be helped.",
    "And We pursued them in this world with a curse. And on Resurrection Day, they will be among the uglified.",
    "And We gave Moses the Scripture—after We had destroyed the previous generations—as insight for people, and guidance and mercy, so that they may reflect.",
    "You were not on the Western Side when We entrusted the Commandments to Moses, nor were you of the witnesses.",
    "But We established many generations, and life grew long for them. Nor were you among the people of Median, reading Our revelations to them. But We kept sending messengers.",
    "Nor were you by the side of the Mount when We announced. But it was a mercy from your Lord, to warn a people who received no warner before you, so they may take notice.",
    "Otherwise, if a calamity befell them because of what their hands have perpetrated, they would say, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations, and been among the believers.”",
    "But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was given the like of what was given to Moses.” Did they not deny what was given to Moses in the past? They said, “Two works of magic, backing one another.” And they said, “We are rejecting both.”",
    "Say, “Then bring a scripture from God, more conducive to guidance than both, and I will follow it—if you are truthful.”",
    "But if they do not respond to you, then know that they follow their fancies. And who is more lost than he who follows his fancy without guidance from God? God does not guide the unjust people.",
    "We have conveyed to them the Word, so they may reflect.",
    "Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it—they are believers in it.",
    "And when it is read to them, they say, “We believe in it; it is the truth from our Lord; we were Submitters prior to it.”",
    "These will be given their reward twice—because they persevered. And they counter bad with good. And from Our provisions to them, they give.",
    "And when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it, and say, “We have our deeds, and you have your deeds; peace be upon you; we do not desire the ignorant.”",
    "You cannot guide whom you love, but God guides whom He wills, and He knows best those who are guided.",
    "And they say, “If we follow the guidance with you, we will be snatched away from our land.” Did we not establish for them a Safe Sanctuary, to which fruits of all kinds are brought, as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know.",
    "And how many a town have We destroyed who exulted in their life of ease? Here are their dwellings, uninhabited after them, except for a few. And We are the Inheritors.",
    "Your Lord never destroys towns without first sending a messenger in their midst, reading to them Our revelations. And We never destroy towns, unless their people are wrongdoers.",
    "Whatever you are given is only the enjoyment of this life—and its glitter. But what is with God is better, and longer-lasting. Do you not comprehend?",
    "Can someone to whom We promised a good promise—which he will attain—be equal to someone to whom We gave enjoyments in this world, but who will be, on Resurrection Day, among the arraigned?",
    "On the Day when He calls out to them, and He says, “Where are My partners, those whom you claimed?”",
    "Those against whom the Word is justified will say, “Our Lord, these are the ones we caused to deviate. We caused them to deviate, as we ourselves deviated. We declare our innocence to You. It was not us they worshiped.”",
    "And it will be said, “Call on your partners.” And they will call on them, but they will not answer them. And they will see the suffering. If only they were guided!",
    "On the Day when He calls out to them, and He says, “what did you answer the Messengers?”",
    "They will be blinded by the facts on that Day, and they will not ask one another.",
    "As for he who repents, believes, and works righteousness: he may well be among the winners.",
    "Your Lord creates whatever He wills, and He chooses. The choice is not theirs. Glory be to God, and exalted is He above the associations they make.",
    "And your Lord knows what their hearts conceal, and what they disclose.",
    "He is God. There is no god except He. To Him belongs all praise in this life, and in the next. All authority is His. And to Him, you will be returned.",
    "Say, “Have you considered? If God were to make the night continuous over you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than God could bring you light? Do you not listen?”",
    "Say, “Have you considered? If God were to make the day continuous over you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than God could bring you night, to rest in? Do you not see?”",
    "Out of His mercy, He made for you the night and the day, so that you may rest in it, and to seek of His bounty, so that you may give thanks.",
    "On the Day when He calls out to them, and He says, “Where are My associates, those whom you claimed?”",
    "And We will pull a witness from every group, then say, “Produce your evidence.” Then they will realize that the truth is God’s, and those they used to invent have abandoned them.",
    "Korah belonged to the people of Moses, but he exploited them. We had given him treasures, the keys of which would burden a group of strong men. When his people said to him, “Do not be overjoyed; God does not like the exultant.",
    "But seek, with what God has given you, the Home of the Hereafter. And do not neglect your share of this world. And be charitable, as God is charitable to you. And do not work corruption on earth—God does not like the corruptors.”",
    "He said, “I was able to obtain this because of the knowledge I have.” Did he not know that God has destroyed generations before him, who were stronger than him, and possessed greater riches? But the guilty will not be asked about their sins.",
    "And he came out before his people in his splendor. Those who desired the worldly life said, “If only we possessed the likes of what Korah was given. He is truly very fortunate.”",
    "But those gifted with knowledge said, “Woe to you! The reward of God is better for those who believe and work righteousness.” Yet none attains it except the patient.",
    "So We caused the earth to cave in on him and his mansion. He had no company to save him from God, nor could he defend himself.",
    "And those who desired his position the day before were saying, “Alas! It seems God gives abundantly to whom He wills of His servants, or sparingly. Had God not been gracious to us, He would have caved in on us. Oh, certainly, the ungrateful never prosper.”",
    "That Home of the Hereafter—We reserve it to those who seek no superiority on earth, nor corruption. And the outcome is for the cautious.",
    "Whoever comes with virtue will have what is better. But whoever comes with evil—the evildoers will be punished only for what they used to do.",
    "He Who mandated the Quran to you will return you Home. Say, “My Lord knows best anyone who brought the guidance, and who is in obvious error.”",
    "You did not expect the Scripture to be transmitted to you, except mercy from your Lord. So do not be a supporter of the unbelievers.",
    "And do not let them divert you from God’s revelations after they have been revealed to you. And pray to your Lord, and never be of the associators.",
    "And do not call upon another god along with God—there is no god but He. All things perish, except His essence. Judgment belongs to Him. And to Him, you will be returned."
