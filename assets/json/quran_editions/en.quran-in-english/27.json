    "Guidance and good news for the believers.",
    "Those who perform the prayer, and give charity regularly, and are certain of the Hereafter.",
    "As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter: We made their deeds appear good to them, so they wander aimlessly.",
    "It is they who will suffer a dreadful torment—and in the Hereafter, they will be the worst losers.",
    "You are receiving the Quran from an All-Wise, All-Knowing.",
    "When Moses said to his family, “I have noticed a fire. I will bring you some news from it; or bring you a torch, so that you may warm yourselves.”",

    "And We gave David and Solomon knowledge. And they said, “Praise be to God, who has favored us over many of His believing servants.”",
    "And Solomon succeeded David. He said, “O people, we were taught the language of birds, and we were given of all things. This is indeed the obvious grace.”",
    "And gathered for Solomon were his troops of sprites, men, and birds—all held in strict order.",
    "Until, when they came upon the Valley of the Ants, an ant said, “O ants, go into your dwellings, lest Solomon and his troops crush you, while they are unaware.”",
    "So he smiled, laughing at her words, and said, “My Lord, direct me to be thankful for Your blessings that You bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and to work righteousness, pleasing you. And admit me, by Your grace, into the company of Your virtuous worshipers.”",
    "Then he surveyed the birds, and said, “How is it that I do not see the hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?",
    "I will punish him most severely, or slay him—unless he brings me a valid excuse.”",
    "But he did not stay away for long. He said, “I have learned something you did not know. I have come to you from Sheba, with reliable information.",
    "I found a woman ruling over them, and she was given of all things, and she has a magnificent throne.",

    "He who had knowledge from the Scripture said, “I can bring it to you before you blink.” And when he saw it settled before him, he said, “This is of my Lord’s grace, to test me, whether I am appreciative or unappreciative. Whoever is grateful, his gratitude is for his own soul; and whoever is ungrateful—my Lord is Independent and Generous.”",
    "He said, “Disguise her throne for her, and we shall see whether she will be guided, or remains one of the misguided.”",

    "It was said to her, “Go inside the courtyard.” And when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she uncovered her legs. He said, “It is a courtyard paved with crystal.” She said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself, and I have submitted with Solomon, to God, Lord of the Worlds.”",
    "And We sent to Thamood their brother Saleh: “Worship God.” But they became two disputing factions.",
