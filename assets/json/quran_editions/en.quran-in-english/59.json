    "Glorifying God is all that exists in the heavens and the earth. He is the Powerful, the Wise.",
    "It is He who evicted those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture from their homes at the first mobilization. You never thought they would leave, and they thought their strongholds would protect them from God. But God came at them from where they never expected, and He threw panic into their hearts. They wrecked their homes with their own hands, and by the hands of the believers. So take a lesson, O you who have insight.",
    "Had God not decreed evacuation for them, He would have punished them in this life. And in the Hereafter, they will have the suffering of the Fire.",
    "That is because they opposed God and His Messenger. Whoever opposes God—God is severe in retribution.",
    "Whatever palm-trees you cut down, or left it standing on its roots, it is by God’s will. So that He may disgrace the disobedient.",
    "As for the gains God has turned over to His Messenger from them—you spurred neither horse nor camel for them. But God gives authority to His messengers over whomever He wills, and God is capable of all things.",
    "As for gains granted by God to His Messenger from the villages' inhabitants, they are for God and His Messenger, and the relatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the homeless; so that it may not circulate between the wealthy among you. Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it. And whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. And be mindful of God. God is severe in punishment.",
    "For the poor refugees who were expelled from their homes and their property, seeking bounty and approval from God, and standing up for God and His Messenger. These are the truthful.",
    "As for those who had settled in the homeland before them, and had accepted faith—they love those who emigrated to them, and they find no hesitation in their hearts in helping them. They give them preference over themselves, even if they themselves are needy. Whoever is protected from his own selfishness—it is they who are the successful.",
    "And those who came after them, saying, “Our Lord, forgive us, and our fellow believers who have preceded us in faith, and leave no bitterness in our hearts towards those who believe. Our Lord, You are Clement and Merciful.”",
    "Have you not seen those who act hypocritically? They say to their fellow disbelievers among the People of the Scripture, “If you are expelled, we will leave with you, and We will never obey anyone against you. And if you are fought against, we will support you.” But God bears witness that they are liars.",
    "If they are expelled, they will not leave with them. And if they are fought against, they will not support them. And if they go to their aid, they will turn their backs and flee. And they will be left without help.",
    "Fear of you is more intense in their hearts than fear of God. That is because they are a people who do not understand.",
    "They will not fight you all together, except from fortified strongholds, or from behind walls. Their hostility towards each other is severe. You think they are united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who do not reason.",
    "Like those shortly before them. They tasted the consequences of their decisions. For them is a painful punishment.",
    "Like Satan, when he says to the human being, “Disbelieve.” But when he has disbelieved, he says, “I am innocent of you; I fear God, Lord of the Worlds.”",
    "The ultimate end for both is the Fire, where they will dwell forever. That is the penalty of the wrongdoers.",
    "O you who believe! Fear God, and let every soul consider what it has forwarded for tomorrow, and be conscious of God. God is well informed of what you do.",
    "And be not like those who forgot God, so He made them forget themselves. These are the sinners.",
    "Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the inhabitants of Paradise who are the winners.",
    "Had We made this Quran descend on a mountain, you would have seen it trembling, crumbling in awe of God. These parables We cite for the people, so that they may reflect.",
    "He is God—other than Whom there is no god, Knower of secrets and declarations. He is the Compassionate, the Merciful.",
    "He is God—besides Whom there is no god, the Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace-Giver, the Faith-Giver, the Overseer, the Almighty, the Omnipotent, the Proud. Glorified is God, beyond what they associate.",
    "He is God—the Creator, the Inventor, the Designer. His are the Most Beautiful Names. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth praises Him. And He is the Majestic, the Wise."
