    "In the Gardens of Bliss.",
    "A group from the ancients.",
    "And a few from the latecomers.",
    "On jeweled thrones.",
    "Reclining on them, facing one another.",
    "Circulating among them will be eternalized youth.",
    "With goblets, pitchers, and a cup from a flowing spring.",

    "The likenesses of pristine pearls.",
    "A reward for what they used to do.",
    "In it they will hear no nonsense and no accusations.",
    "But only the greeting: “Peace, peace.”",
    "And those on the Right—what of those on the Right?",

    "And sweet-smelling plants.",
    "And extended shade.",
    "And outpouring water.",
    "And abundant fruit.",
    "Never out of season, and never forbidden.",

    "And a shade of black smoke.",
    "Neither cool nor refreshing.",
    "Before that, they lived in luxury.",
    "And they persisted in immense wrongdoing.",
    "And they used to say, “When we are dead and become dust and bones, are we to be resurrected?",

    "Drinking as parched camels drink.",
    "This is their hospitality on the Day of Retribution.",
    "We created you—if only you would believe!",
    "Have you seen what you ejaculate?",

    "We mandated death among you, and We will not be surpassed.",
    "In replacing you with your likes, and transforming you into what you do not know.",
    "You have known the first formation. Then why do you not reflect?",
    "Have you seen what you cultivate?",
    "Is it you who sow it, or are We the Sowers?",
    "If We will, We can turn it into rubble; then you will lament.",
    "“We are penalized.",
    "No—we have been deprived.”",
    "Have you seen the water that you drink?",
    "Is it you who sent it down from the clouds, or are We the senders?",
    "If We will, We can make it bitter. So why are you not thankful?",
    "Have you seen the fire you kindle?",
    "Is it you who produce its tree, or are We the Producers?",
    "We made it a reminder, and comfort for the users.",
    "So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Great.",

    "It is a Noble Quran.",
    "In a well-protected Book.",
    "None can grasp it except the purified.",
    "A revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.",
    "Is it this discourse that you take so lightly?",
    "And you make it your livelihood to deny it?",
    "So when it has reached the throat.",
    "While you are looking on.",
    "We are closer to it than you are, but you cannot see.",
    "Why, then, if you are unconstrained.",
    "You do not bring it back, if you are truthful?",
    "But if he is one of those brought near.",
    "Then happiness, and fragrance, and Garden of Delights.",
    "And if he is among those on the Right.",
    "Then, “Peace upon you,” from those on the Right.",
    "But if he is among the deniers, the mistaken.",
    "Then a welcome of Inferno.",
    "And burning in Hell.",
    "This is the absolute truth.",
    "So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Magnificent."
