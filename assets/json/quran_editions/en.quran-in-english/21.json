    "People’s reckoning has drawn near, but they turn away heedlessly.",

    "And they said, “A jumble of dreams,” and, “He made it up,” and, “He is a poet,” “Let him bring us a miracle, like those sent to the ancients.”",
    "None of the towns We destroyed before them had believed. Will they then believe?",
    "We did not send before you except men, whom We inspired. Ask the people of knowledge, if you do not know.",

    "We revealed to you a Book containing your mention. Do you not reason?",
    "How many a guilty town have We shattered, and We established thereafter another people?",

    "This continued to be their cry—until We made them silent ashes.",

    "To Him belongs everyone in the heavens and on earth. Those near Him are never too proud to worship Him, nor do they tire.",
    "They praise night and day, without wavering.",
    "Or have they taken gods from the earth, who resurrect?",
    "If there were in them gods other than God, they would have gone to ruin. So glory be to God, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe.",
    "He will not be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.",
    "Or have they taken gods besides Him? Say, “Produce your proof. This is a Message for those with me, and a Message for those before me.” But most of them do not know the truth, so they turn away.",
    "We sent no messenger before you, without inspiring him that: “There is no god except I, so worship Me.”",
    "And they say, “The Mercy-Giver has taken a son.” Be He glorified; they are but honored servants.",
    "They do not precede Him in speech, and they act according to His command.",
    "He knows what is ahead of them, and what is behind them. And they cannot intercede, except for whom He approves. And they tremble in awe of Him.",

    "If those who disbelieve only knew, when they cannot keep the fire off their faces, and off their backs, and they will not be helped.",
    "In fact, it will come upon them suddenly, and it will bewilder them. They will be unable to repel it, and they will not be delayed.",
    "Messengers before you were ridiculed, but those who jeered became besieged by what they used to ridicule.",

    "This too is a blessed message that We revealed. Are you going to deny it?",
