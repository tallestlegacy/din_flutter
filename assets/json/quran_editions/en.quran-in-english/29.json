    "Alif. Lam. Meem.",
    "Do people think they will be left alone to say, \"We believe,\" without being tested?",
    "We tested those before them. God certainly knows those who are thankful, and He certainly knows the liars.",
    "Or do those who commit bad deeds think they can outdo us? Terrible is their judgment!",
    "Whoever looks forward to the meeting with God—God's appointed time is coming. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.",
    "Whoever strives, strives only for himself. God is beyond the need of the worlds.",
    "Those who believe and do good works: We will remit their sins, and We will reward them according to the best of what they used to do.",
    "We have advised the human being to be good to his parents. But if they urge you to associate with Me what you have no knowledge of, do not obey them. To Me is your return, and I will inform you of what you used to do.",
    "Those who believe and do good works: We will admit them with the righteous.",
    "And among the people are those who say, “We have believed in God.” But if he is harmed for the sake of God, he equates people's persecution with God’s retribution. And if help comes from your Lord, he will say, “We were with you.” Does God not know what lies in the chests of all beings?",
    "God certainly knows those who believe, and He certainly knows the hypocrites.",
    "Those who disbelieve say to those who believe, “Follow our path, and we will carry your sins.” In no way can they carry any of their sins. They are liars.",
    "They will carry their own loads—and other loads with their own loads. And they will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about what they used to fabricate.",
    "We sent Noah to his people, and He remained among them for a thousand years, less fifty years. Then the Deluge overtook them while they were wrongdoers.",
    "But We saved him, together with the Ark's occupants, and We made it a sign for all people.",
    "And Abraham, when he said to his people, “Worship God and reverence Him. That is better for you—if you only knew.",
    "You worship idols besides God, and you fabricate falsehoods. Those you worship, instead of God, cannot provide you with a livelihood. So seek your livelihood from God, and worship Him, and be thankful to Him. To Him, you will be returned.”",
    "If you deny, communities before you also denied. The Messenger’s duty is only clear proclamation.",
    "Have they not considered how God originates creation, and then reproduces it? That is easy for God.",
    "Say, “Roam the earth, and observe how He originated creation.” Then God will bring about the next existence. God is Powerful over all things.”",
    "He punishes whom He wills, and He shows mercy to whom He wills. And to Him, you will be restored.",
    "You cannot escape on earth, nor in heaven. And apart from God, you have no protector, nor helper.",
    "Those who disbelieve in God’s communications and in the meeting with Him—it is they who have despaired of My mercy, and for them is a painful punishment.",
    "But the only response of his people was to say: “Kill him, or burn him!” But God saved him from the fire. Surely in this are signs for people who believe.",
    "And he said, “You have chosen idols instead of God, out of affection for one another in this worldly life. But then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will disown one another, and curse one another, and your home will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers.”",
    "Then Lot believed in him, and said, “I am emigrating to my Lord. He is the Noble, the Wise.”",
    "And We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and We bestowed on his descendants Prophethood and the Scripture. And We gave him his reward in this life. And in the Hereafter, he will be among the upright.",
    "And Lot, when he said to his people, “You are committing an obscenity not committed by anyone before you in the world.",
    "You approach men, and cut off the highway, and commit lewdness in your gatherings.” But his people’s only response was to say, “Bring God’s punishment upon us, if you are truthful.”",
    "He said, “My Lord, help me against the people of corruption.”",
    "And when Our Envoys came to Abraham with the good news, they said, “We will destroy the people of this town—its people are wrongdoers.”",
    "He said, “But Lot is in it.” They said, “We are well aware of who is in it. We will save him and his family, except for his wife, she will be among those remaining behind.”",
    "And when Our Envoys came to Lot, they were mistreated, and he was distressed by their arrival. They said, “Do not fear, nor grieve. We will save you and your family, except for your wife; she is among those lagging behind.”",
    "“We will bring down upon the people of this town a scourge from heaven, because of their rebelliousness.”",
    "And We left behind a clear trace of it, for people who understand.",
    "And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He said, “O my people, serve God and anticipate the Last Day, and do not behave wickedly on earth, spreading corruption.”",
    "But they rejected him, and so the tremor overtook them, and they were left motionless in their homes.",
    "And Aad, and Thamood. It has become obvious to you from their dwellings. Satan embellished for them their deeds, barring them from the path, even though they could see.",
    "And Korah, and Pharaoh, and Hamaan: Moses went to them with clear arguments, but they acted arrogantly in the land. And they could not get ahead.",
    "Each We seized by his sin. Against some, We sent a sandstorm. And some were struck by the Blast. And some We caused the ground to cave in beneath them. And some We drowned. It was not God who wronged them, but it was they who wronged their own selves.",
    "The similitude of those who take protectors other than God is that of the spider. It builds a home. But the most fragile of homes is the spider’s home; if they only knew.",
    "God knows whatever they invoke besides Him. And He is the Almighty, the Wise.",
    "These examples—We site them to the people, but none grasps them except the learned.",
    "God created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. Surely in this is a sign for believers.",
    "Recite what is revealed to you of the Scripture, and perform the prayer. The prayer prevents indecency and abomination. And the remembrance of God is more excellent. And God knows what you do.",
    "And do not debate with the People of the Scripture except in the best manner possible, except those among them who do wrong. And say, “We believe in what was revealed to us, and in what was revealed to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him we are submitters.”",
    "Likewise, We revealed to you the Scripture. Those to whom We gave the Scripture believe in it. And among these are some who believe in it. None reject Our communications except the unbelievers.",
    "You did not read any scripture before this, nor did you write it with your hand. Otherwise, the falsifiers would have doubted.",
    "In fact, it is clear signs in the hearts of those given knowledge. And none deny Our revelations except the wrongdoers.",
    "And they say, “If only a miracle was sent down to him from his Lord.” Say, “The Miracles are only with God, and I am only a clear warner.”",
    "Does it not suffice them that We revealed to you the Scripture, recited to them? Surely in this is mercy and a reminder for people who believe.",
    "Say, “God suffices as a witness between you and me. He knows everything in the heavens and on earth. Those who believe in vanity and reject God—it is they who are the losers.”",
    "And they challenge you to expedite the punishment. Were it not for a specified time, the punishment would have come to them. But it will come upon them suddenly, while they are unaware.",
    "And they dare you to expedite the punishment. But Hell will engulf the disbelievers.",
    "On the Day when the punishment will overwhelm them: from above them, and from beneath their feet, and He will say, “Taste what you used to do!”",
    "O My servants who have believed: My earth is vast, so worship only Me.",
    "Every soul will taste death. Then to Us, you will be returned.",
    "Those who believe and work righteousness—We will settle them in Paradise, in mansions under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. Excellent is the reward of the workers.",
    "Those who endure patiently, and trust in their Lord.",
    "How many a creature there is that does not carry its sustenance? God provides for them, and for you. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable.",
    "And if you asked them, “Who created the heavens and the earth, and regulated the sun and the moon?” They would say, “God.” Then why do they deviate?",
    "God outspreads the provision to whomever He wills of His servants, and He restricts it. God is Cognizant of all things.",
    "And if you asked them, “Who sends water down from the sky, with which He revives the earth after its death?” They would say, “God.” Say, “Praise be to God.” But most of them do not think.",
    "This worldly life is nothing but diversion and play. But the Home of the Hereafter is the Real Life—if they only knew.",
    "When they embark on a vessel, they pray to God, devoting their faith to Him. But once He has delivered them safely to land, they attribute partners to Him.",
    "To be ungrateful for what We have given them, and to enjoy themselves. They will come to know.",
    "Do they not see how We established a Secure Sanctuary, while all around them people are being carried away? Do they believe in falsehood and reject God’s blessings?",
    "Who is more unjust than he who fabricates lies and attributes them to God, or calls the truth a lie when it has come to him? Is there not in Hell a dwelling for the blasphemers?",
    "And as for those who strive for Us: We will guide them in Our ways. And God is with the doers of good."
