    "By the dawn.",
    "And ten nights.",
    "And the even and the odd.",
    "And the night as it recedes.",
    "Is there an oath in that for a rational person?",
    "Did you not see how your Lord dealt with Aad?",
    "Erum of the pillars.",
    "The like of which was never created in the land.",
    "And Thamood—those who carved out the rocks in the Valley.",
    "And Pharaoh of the Stakes.",
    "Those who committed excesses in the lands.",
    "And spread much corruption in it.",
    "So your Lord poured down on them a scourge of punishment.",
    "Your Lord is on the lookout.",
    "As for the human being, whenever his Lord tests him, and honors him, and prospers him, he says, “My Lord has honored me.”",
    "But whenever He tests him, and He restricts his livelihood for him, he says, “My Lord has disgraced me.”",
    "Not at all. But you are not generous towards the orphan.",
    "And you do not urge the feeding of the poor.",
    "And you devour inheritance with all greed.",
    "And you love wealth with immense love.",
    "No—when the earth is pounded, crushed, and leveled.",
    "And your Lord comes, with the angels, row after row.",
    "And on that Day, Hell will be brought. On that Day, the human being will remember, but how will remembrance avail him?",
    "He will say, “If only I had forwarded for my life.”",
    "On that Day, none will punish as He punishes.",
    "And none will shackle as He shackles.",
    "But as for you, O tranquil soul.",
    "Return to your Lord, pleased and accepted.",
    "Enter among My worshipers.",
    "Enter My Garden."
