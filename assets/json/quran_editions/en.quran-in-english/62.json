    "Everything in the heavens and the earth praises God—the Sovereign, the Holy, the Almighty, the Wise.",
    "It is He who sent among the unlettered a messenger from among themselves; reciting to them His revelations, and purifying them, and teaching them the Scripture and Wisdom; although they were previously clearly misguided.",
    "And others among them, who have not yet joined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise.",
    "That is God’s grace, which He gives to whom He wills. God is Lord of infinite grace.",
    "The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah, but failed to uphold it, is that of a donkey carrying volumes of knowledge. Terrible is the example of the people who reject God’s signs. God does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
    "Say, “O you who follow Judaism! If you claim to be the friends of God, to the exclusion of the rest of humanity, then wish for death, if what you say is true.”",
    "But they will not wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have done. And God knows the wrongdoers.",
    "Say, “The death from which you are fleeing will meet you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the unknown and the known, and He will inform you of what you used to do.”",
    "O you who believe! When you are called to the congregational prayer, proceed to God’s remembrance, and drop all business. That is better for you—if you only knew.",
    "Then, when the prayer is concluded, disperse throughout the land, and seek God’s bounty, and remember God often, so that you may prosper.",
    "Yet whenever they come across some business or some entertainment, they scramble towards it, and they leave you standing. Say, “What is with God is better than entertainment and business, and God is the Best of providers.”"
