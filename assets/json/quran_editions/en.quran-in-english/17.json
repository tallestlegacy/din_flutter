    "Glory be to Him, Who journeyed His servant by night, from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque, whose precincts We have blessed, to show him of Our wonders. He is the Listener, the Beholder.",
    "And We gave Moses the Scripture, and We made it a guidance for the Children of Israel: Take no guardian apart from Me.",
    "The descendants of those We carried with Noah. He was an appreciative servant.",
    "And We declared for the Children of Israel in the Scripture: You will commit corruption on earth twice, and you will rise to a great height.",
    "When the first of the two promises came true, We sent against you servants of Ours, possessing great might, and they ransacked your homes. It was a promise fulfilled.",
    "Then We gave you a turn against them, and We supplied you with wealth and children, and We made you more numerous.",
    "If you work righteousness, you work righteousness for yourselves; and if you commit evil, you do so against yourselves. Then, when the second promise comes true, they will make your faces filled with sorrow, and will enter the Temple as they entered it the first time, and will utterly destroy all that falls into their power.",
    "Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you. And if you return, We will return. And We made Hell a prison for the unbelievers.",
    "This Quran guides to what is most upright. And it gives good news to the believers who do good deeds, that they will have a great reward.",
    "And those who do not believe in the Hereafter—We have prepared for them a painful punishment.",
    "The human being prays for evil as he prays for good. The human being is ever hasty.",
    "And We made the night and the day two wonders. We erased the wonder of the night, and We made the wonder of the day revealing, so that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and know the number of years and the calculation. We explained everything in detail.",
    "And We attached every person’s deeds to his neck. And on the Day of Resurrection, We will bring out for him a book which he will find wide open.",
    "“Read your book! Today, you are sufficient to call yourself to account.”",
    "Whoever is guided—is guided for his own good. And whoever goes astray—goes astray to his detriment. No burdened soul carries the burdens of another, nor do We ever punish until We have sent a messenger.",
    "And when We intend to destroy a town, We command its affluent ones; they transgress in it, so the word becomes justified against it, and We destroy it utterly.",
    "How many generations have We destroyed after Noah? Your Lord is sufficient as Knower and Beholder of the sins of his servants.",
    "Whoever desires the fleeting life, We expedite for him what We decide to give him, to whomever We will. Then We consign him to Gehenna, where he will roast, condemned and defeated.",
    "But whoever desires the Hereafter, and pursues it as it should be pursued, while he is a believer; these—their efforts will be appreciated.",
    "To all—these and those—We extend from the gifts of your Lord. Your Lord’s gifts are not restricted.",
    "Observe how We have favored some of them over others. Yet the Hereafter is greater in ranking and greater in preference.",
    "Do not set up with God another god, lest you become condemned and damned.",

    "And give the relative his rights, and the poor, and the wayfarer. And do not squander wastefully.",

    "Your Lord extends the provision to whomever He wills, and He restricts it. He is fully Informed, Observant of His servants.",
    "And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them, and for you. Killing them is a heinous sin.",
    "And do not go near adultery. It is immoral, and an evil way.",
    "And do not kill the soul which God has made sacred, except in the pursuit of justice. If someone is killed unjustly, We have given his next of kin authority. But he should not be excessive in taking life, for he will be supported.",
    "And do not go near the orphan’s wealth, except with the best of intentions, until he has reached maturity. And honor your pledges: a promise involves responsibility.",
    "And give full measure when you measure. And weigh with accurate scales. That is fairer, and the best determination.",
    "And do not follow what you have no knowledge of. The hearing, the sight, and the intellect—all these will be questioned.",
    "And do not walk on the earth arrogantly. You can neither penetrate the earth, nor can you reach the mountains in height.",
    "The evil of all these is disliked by your Lord.",
    "That is from the wisdom your Lord has revealed to you. And do not set up another god with God, lest you be thrown in Hell, rebuked and banished.",
    "Has your Lord favored you with sons, while choosing for Himself females from among the angels? You are making an outrageous claim.",
    "We have explained in this Quran in various ways, so that they may reflect. But it only adds to their rebellion.",
    "Say, “If there were other gods with Him—as they say—they would have sought a way to the Lord of the Throne.”",
    "Glorified be He! He is exalted, far above what they say.",
    "Praising Him are the seven heavens, and the earth, and everyone in them. There is not a thing that does not glorify Him with praise, but you do not understand their praises. He is Patient and Forgiving.",
    "When you read the Quran, We place between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter a hidden veil.",
    "And We drape coverings over their hearts—leaving them unable to understand it—and deafness in their ears. And when you mention your Lord’s oneness in the Quran, they turn their backs in disgust.",

    "Note what they compared you to. They are lost, and unable to find a way.",
    "And they say: “When we have become bones and fragments, shall we be raised as a new creation?”",
    "Say, “Even if you become rocks or iron.",
    "Or some substance, which in your minds, is even harder.” Then they will say, “Who will restore us?” Say, “He who originated you the first time.” Then they will nod their heads at you, and say, “When will it be?” Say, “It may well be soon.”",
    "On the Day when He calls you, you will respond with His praise, and you will realize that you stayed for only a little while.",
    "Tell My worshipers to say what is best. Satan sows discord among them. Satan is to the human being an obvious enemy.",
    "Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He will have mercy on you; and if He wills, He will punish you. We did not send you as their advocate.",
    "Your Lord knows well everyone in the heavens and the earth. We have given some prophets advantage over others. And to David, We gave the Psalms.",
    "Say, “Call upon those you claim besides Him. They have no power to relieve your adversity, nor can they change it.”",
    "Those they call upon are themselves seeking means to their Lord, vying to be nearer, hoping for His mercy, and fearing His punishment. Your Lord’s punishment is to be avoided.",
    "There is no town, but We will destroy before the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with severe punishment. That is inscribed in the Book.",
    "Nothing prevents Us from sending miracles, except that the ancients denied them. And We gave Thamood the female camel, an eye-opener, but they mistreated her. We do not send signs, except to instill reverence.",
    "We told you that your Lord encompasses humanity. We did not make the vision that We showed you, except as a test for the people, and the Cursed Tree in the Quran. We frighten them, but it only increases them in defiance.",
    "And We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they prostrated, except for Iblis. He said, “Should I prostrate before someone You created from mud?”",
    "He said, “Do You see this one that You honored over me? If You delay me until the Day of Resurrection, I will bring his descendants under my sway, except for a few.”",

    "When harm afflicts you at sea, those you pray to vanish, except for Him. But when He has saved you to shore, you turn away. The human being is ungrateful.",
    "Do you feel secure that He will not cause a tract of land to cave in beneath you, or unleash a tornado against you? Then you will find none to protect you.",
    "Or do you feel secure that He will not return you to it once again, and unleash a hurricane against you, and drown you for your ingratitude? Then you will find no supporter against Us.",
    "We have honored the Children of Adam, and We carried them on land and sea, and We provided them with good things, and We greatly favored them over many of those We created.",
    "On the Day when We call every people by their leader. Whoever is given his record in his right hand—these will read their record, and they will not be wronged one bit.",

    "And say, “The truth has come, and falsehood has withered away. Falsehood is bound to wither away.”",
    "We send down in the Quran healing and mercy for believers. And it increases the wrongdoers in nothing but loss.",
    "When We bless the human being, he turns away and distances himself. But when adversity touches him—he is in despair.",
    "Say, “Each does according to his disposition. Your Lord knows best who is better guided in the way.”",
    "And they ask you about the Spirit. Say, “The Spirit belongs to the domain of my Lord, and you were given only a little knowledge.”",
    "If We willed, We could take away what We revealed to you. Then you will find for yourself no protecting guardian against Us.",
    "Except through mercy from your Lord. His favor upon you is immense.",

    "We have displayed for the people in this Quran every kind of similitude, but most people persist in disbelief.",

    "Or you cause the sky to fall on us in pieces, as you claim, or you bring God and the angels before us.",
    "Or you possess a house of gold. Or you ascend up the sky. Even then, we will not believe in your ascension, unless you bring down for us a book that we can read.” Say, “Glory be to my Lord! Am I anything but a human messenger?”",
    "Nothing prevented the people from believing, when guidance has come to them, except that they said, “Did God send a human messenger?”",
    "Say, “If there were angels on earth, walking around in peace, We would have sent down to them from heaven an angel messenger.”",
    "Say, “God is enough as a witness between me and you. He is fully aware of His servants, and He sees them well.”",
    "Whomever God guides is the guided one. And whomever He leaves astray—you will find no guardians for them besides Him. And We will drag them on their faces on the Day of Resurrection—blind, dumb, and deaf. Their housing is hell. Whenever it abates, We will intensify the blaze for them.",
    "That is their payback for having rejected Our revelations, and having said, “When we are reduced to bones and fragments, will we be raised as a new creation?”",
    "Do they not consider that God, Who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create the likes of them? He has assigned for them a time, about which there is no doubt. But the wrongdoers persist in denial.",
    "Say, “If you possessed the treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, you would have withheld, for fear of spending.” The human being has always been stingy.",

    "And after him, We said to the Children of Israel, “Inhabit the land, and when the promise of the Hereafter arrives, We will bring you all together.”",
    "In truth, We sent it down. And with the truth, it descended. We sent you only as a deliverer of good news and a warner.",
    "A Quran which We unfolded gradually, so you may read it to people over time. And We revealed it in stages.",
    "Say, “Believe in it, or do not believe.” Those who were given knowledge before it, when it is read to them, they fall to their chins, in prostration.",
    "And they say, “Glory to our Lord. The promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.”",
    "And they fall to their chins, weeping, and it adds to their humility.",
    "Say, “Call upon God, or call upon the Compassionate. Whichever you call upon, He has the Most Beautiful Names.” And be neither loud in your prayer, nor silent in it, but seek a way in between.",
    "And say, “Praise be to God, who has not begotten a child, nor has He a partner in sovereignty, nor has He an ally out of weakness, and proclaim His Greatness!”"
