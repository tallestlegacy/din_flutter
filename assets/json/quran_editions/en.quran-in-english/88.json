    "Has the news of the Overwhelming reached you?",

    "Entering a scorching Fire.",
    "Given to drink from a flaming spring.",
    "They will have no food except thorns.",
    "Neither nourishing nor satisfying hunger.",
    "Faces on that Day will be radiant.",
    "Satisfied with their endeavor.",
    "In a lofty Garden.",
    "In it, you will hear no nonsense.",
    "In it, is a flowing spring.",
    "In it, are raised beds.",
    "And cups set in place.",
    "And cushions lined up.",
    "And carpets spread around.",
    "Do they not look at the camels—how they are created?",
    "And at the sky—how it is raised?",
    "And at the mountains—how they are installed?",
    "And at the earth—how it is spread out?",
    "So remind. You are only a reminder.",
    "You have no control over them.",
    "But whoever turns away and disbelieves.",
    "God will punish him with the greatest punishment.",
    "To Us is their return.",
    "Then upon Us rests their reckoning."
