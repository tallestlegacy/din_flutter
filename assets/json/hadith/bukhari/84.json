The Prophet said, 'O Abu Musa (O 'Abdullah bin Qais!).' I said, 'By Him Who sent you with the Truth, these two men did not tell me what was in their hearts and I did not feel (realize) that they were seeking employment.' As if I were looking now at his Siwak being drawn to a corner under his lips, and he said, 'We never (or, we do not) appoint for our affairs anyone who seeks to be employed. But O Abu Musa! (or 'Abdullah bin Qais!) Go to Yemen.'\" The Prophet then sent Mu'adh bin Jabal after him and when Mu'adh reached him, he spread out a cushion for him and requested him to get down (and sit on the cushion). Behold: There was a fettered man beside Abu Muisa. Mu'adh asked, \"Who is this (man)?\" Abu Muisa said, \"He was a Jew and became a Muslim and then reverted back to Judaism.\" Then Abu Muisa requested Mu'adh to sit down but Mu'adh said, \"I will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of Allah and His Apostle (for such cases) and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered that the man be killed, and he was killed.

I will fight whoever differentiates between prayers and Zakat as Zakat is the right to be taken from property (according to Allah's Orders). By Allah! If they refused to pay me even a kid they used to pay to Allah's Apostle, I would fight with them for withholding it.\" 'Umar said, \"By Allah: It was nothing, but I noticed that Allah opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision to fight, therefore I realized that his decision was right.\"","by":"Narrated by Abu Huraira"},{"id":60,"text":"A Jew passed by Allah's Apostle and said, \"As-Samu 'Alaika.\" Allah's Apostle said in reply, \"We 'Alaika.\" Allah's Apostle then said to his companions, \"Do you know what he (the Jew) has said?

No doubt I heard Allah's Apostle saying, \"During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith) and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game.

Yet they will go out of the religion as an arrow darts through the game's body in which case, if the Qudhadh of the arrow is examined, nothing will be found on it, and when its Nasl is examined, nothing will be found on it; and then its Nadiyi is examined, nothing will be found on it. The arrow has been too fast to be smeared by dung and blood. The sign by which these people will be recognized will be a man whose one hand (or breast) will be like the breast of a woman (or like a moving piece of flesh). These people will appear when there will be differences among the people (Muslims).\" Abu Sa'id added: I testify that I heard this from the Prophet and also testify that 'Ali killed those people while I was with him. The man with the description given by the Prophet was brought to 'Ali. The following Verses were revealed in connection with that very person (i.e., 'Abdullah bin Dhil-Khawaisira At-Tarnimi): 'And among them are men who accuse you (O Muhammad) in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms.'

Join not in worship others with Allah, Verily!

Abu 'Abdur-Rahman said to Hibban, \"You know what made your companions (i.e. Ali) dare to shed blood.\" Hibban said, \"Come on! What is that?\" 'Abdur-Rahman said, \"Something I heard him saying.\" The other said, \"What was it?\" 'AbdurRahman said, \"'Ali said, Allah's Apostle sent for me, Az-Zubair and Abu Marthad, and all of us were cavalry men, and said, 'Proceed to Raudat-Hajj (Abu Salama said that Abu 'Awana called it like this, i.e., Hajj where there is a woman carrying a letter from Hatib bin Abi Balta'a to the pagans (of Mecca). So bring that letter to me.' So we proceeded riding on our horses till we overtook her at the same place of which Allah's Apostle had told us. She was traveling on her camel. In that letter Hatib had written to the Meccans about the proposed attached of Allah's Apostle against them. We asked her, \"Where is the letter which is with you?' She replied, 'I haven't got any letter.' So we made her camel kneel down and searched her luggage, but we did not find anything. My two companions said, 'We do not think that she has got a letter.' I said, 'We know that Allah's Apostle has not told a lie.'\" \r\n\r\nThen 'Ali took an oath saying, \"By Him by Whom one should swear! You shall either bring out the letter or we shall strip off your clothes.\" She then stretched out her hand for her girdle (round her waist) and brought out the paper (letter). They took the letter to Allah's Apostle. 'Umar said, \"O Allah's Apostle! (Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers; let me chop off his neck!\" Allah's Apostle said, \"O Hatib! What obliged you to do what you have done?\" Hatib replied, \"O Allah's Apostle! Why (for what reason) should I not believe in Allah and His Apostle? But I intended to do the (Mecca) people a favor by virtue of which my family and property may be protected as there is none of your companions but has some of his people (relatives) whom Allah urges to protect his family and property.\" The Prophet said, \"He has said the truth; therefore, do not say anything to him except good.\" 'Umar again said, \"O Allah's Apostle! He has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers; let me chop his neck off!\" The Prophet said, \"Isn't he from those who fought the battle of Badr? And what do you know, Allah might have looked at them (Badr warriors) and said (to them), 'Do what you like, for I have granted you Paradise?' \" On that, 'Umar's eyes became flooded with tears and he said, \"Allah and His Apostle know best.\"","by":"Narrated by Unknown"}]}
