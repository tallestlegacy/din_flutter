The order off the Prophet upset me, and I said to myself, \"How will this little milk be enough for the people of As-Suffa?\" thought I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself, but behold! The Prophet came to order me to give that milk to them. I wondered what will remain of that milk for me, but anyway, I could not but obey Allah and His Apostle so I went to the people of As-Suffa and called them, and they came and asked the Prophet's permission to enter. They were admitted and took their seats in the house. \r\n\r\nThe Prophet said, \"O Aba-Hirr!\" I said, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Apostle!\" He said, \"Take it and give it to them.\" So I took the bowl (of Milk) and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and return it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, would drink his fill and return it to me, and I would then offer it to another man who would drink his fill and return it to me. Finally, after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached the Prophet who took the bowl and put it on his hand, looked at me and smiled and said. \"O Aba Hirr!\" I replied, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Apostle!\" He said, \"There remain you and I.\" I said, \"You have said the truth, O Allah's Apostle!\" He said, \"Sit down and drink.\" I sat down and drank.

He kept on telling me repeatedly to drink, till I said, \"No. by Allah Who sent you with the Truth, I have no space for it (in my stomach).\" He said, \"Hand it over to me.\" When I gave him the bowl, he praised Allah and pronounced Allah's Name on it and drank the remaining milk.","by":"Narrated by Abu Huraira"},{"id":460,"text":"I was the first man among the Arabs to throw an arrow for Allah's Cause.
